<h1>The Best Movies According to Mark Howson</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Rocky 2</h3>
<p><h4>This film is my all-time favourite. I think it is a wonderful'never give up' story of true grit and determination.<br /> He is a tough guy with a soft heart. Here's Rockys poem to Adrian</h4>
</p>
<h3>A Poem For Rocky</h3>
<p>Remember when we was on ice skates,<br />
    And I thought you was supposed to be great,<br />
    So I kept giving you lip,<br />
    And you kept trying to slip,<br />
    So I could catch you.<br />
    
    That was our first date,<br />
    And after that,<br />
    Every day was great.<br />
    
    That wherever you go,<br />
    So now I want you to know,<br />
    That wherever you go,<br />
    Atlantic City or in the snow,<br />
    Don’t worry about a thing,<br />
    ’cause as long as I got this ring,<br />
    I’ll always be there to catch you.<br />
